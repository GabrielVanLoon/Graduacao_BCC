long-description: This is the software class dependency network of the JUNG 2.0.1 and javax 1.6.0.7 libraries, namespaces edu.uci.ics.jung and java/javax. The network is directed. Nodes represent classes. An edge between them indicates that there exists a dependency between two classes. As there may be multiple references between classes the network has multiple edges.

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the subelj_jung-j network: This is the software class dependency network of the JUNG 2.0.1 and javax 1.6.0.7 libraries, namespaces edu.uci.ics.jung and java/javax. The network is directed. Nodes represent classes. An edge between them indicates that there exists a dependency between two classes. As there may be multiple references between classes the network has multiple edges.


More information about the network is provided here: 
http://konect.cc/networks/subelj_jung-j

Files: 
    meta.subelj_jung-j -- Metadata about the network 
    out.subelj_jung-j -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.subelj_jung-j are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
        Third column: edge weight
    ent.subelj_jung-j.class.name -- Contains the attribute `name` of entity `class` of the network
